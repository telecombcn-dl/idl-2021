## Registration

Registration procedure depends on the student profile:

* **Bachelor students at ETSETB who can register the 2 ECTS:** Follow the regular schedule from your academic office. There is an extraordinary registration period in mid January.
* **Master students at ETSETB:** This Winter School is a light version of the full MSc course of [Deep learning for Artificial Intelligence](https://telecombcn-dl.github.io/dlai-2019/), taught during the Autumn semester. So we encourage you to sign up for this other one. 
* **Students at UPC but not in ETSETB:** Contact the your academic office and request being allowed to take this course. If accepted, contact [ETSETB academic office](http://www.etsetb.upc.edu/ca/els-serveis/secretaria-oberta) and request more details.
**Industry:** Those industry members interested in the topic are encouraged to apply for the [UPC School](https://www.talent.upc.edu/ing/) postgradute course on [Artificial Intelligence with Deep Learning](https://www.talent.upc.edu/ing/professionals/professors/codi/310400/artificial-intelligence-deep-learning/), running between November 2018 and April 2020.
